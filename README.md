# SQL-Basics-Hypothesis-Testing-Statistical-Significance
This project uses SQLite to search the well-known European Soccer Database to extract the information needed to calculate
wins, losses, and draws for over 25,000 matches across 11 leagues from 2008-2016. Focus then turns to data manipulation and data exploration
to uncover an ostensibly intriguing finding: an unusally high away-win percentage for teams in the Scotland Premier League. This finding leads
to the proposal of a hypothesis and subsequent testing for stastical significance, which is achieved via upsampling. The null hypothesis that 
my finding is simply due to randomness is rejected and the observation that initially caught my eye is confirmed to be statistically significant
at the .05 p-value level.
